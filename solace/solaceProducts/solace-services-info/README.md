# Solace Services Info

Solace Services Info is a lightweight library which defines the common models used to describe Solace Messaging service connections. Packaged within this project is also a utility which non-cloud-platform-deployed applications can use to fetch Solace Messaging service credentials.

## Overview

### The Models

This project contains within it a few models to represent the credentials for Solace Messaging services:

<dl>
    <dt>SolaceServiceCredentials</dt>
    <dd>An interface that represents the general expected contents of the credentials to a Solace Messaging service.</dd>
    <dt>SolaceServiceCredentialsImpl</dt>
    <dd>A Plain Old Java Object (POJO) implementation of SolaceServiceCredentials.</dd>
</dl>

### Solace Messaging Service Credentials Loader

The Solace Messaging Service Credentials Loader is a utility that attempts to standardize the way in which applications can fetch Solace Messaging service credentials from its environment.

This project is intended to be used in applications hosted on environments that do not have a standardized means of connecting to external services. For example, an application deployed in Cloud Foundry can use existing Cloud Foundry tools (e.g. [User-Provided Services](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html)) to connect to external services and would have little value in using this project. Whereas, for example, if it were instead to be ran directly on a Windows or Unix environment, then this project could be used to skip the overhead required to fetch and marshal Solace Messaging service credentials.

The primary way of using this loader is through the [SolaceCredentialsLoader](src/main/java/com/solace/services/core/loader/SolaceCredentialsLoader.java). For example:

```java
SolaceCredentialsLoader solaceCredentialsLoader = new SolaceCredentialsLoader();

// Gets the map of service ID to credentials for all detected Solace Messaging services
Map<String, SolaceServiceCredentials> solaceServicesCredentials = solaceCredentialsLoader.getAllSolaceServiceInfo();

// Gets the credentials for the first detected Solace Messaging service
SolaceServiceCredentials solaceServicesCredentials = solaceCredentialsLoader.getSolaceServiceInfo();
```

The two following projects are real examples that use this as one of the options for fetching service credentials to auto-configure Solace Java/JMS connections:
* [Spring Boot Auto-Configuration for the Solace Java API](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-java-spring-boot)
* [Spring Boot Auto-Configuration for the Solace JMS API](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-jms-spring-boot)

Please refer to [Manifest Load Order and Expected Formats](#manifest-load-order-and-expected-formats) for more information about the supported manifest formats and the ways in which you can provide it.

## Manifest Load Order and Expected Formats

The credentials loader for Solace Messaging services works in two phases:
1. Fetch the raw JSON manifest from the application's environment as per a predefined lookup order.
2. Marshal the raw JSON manifest into one or more `SolaceServiceCredentials`.

The order in which the loader searches its environment is currently defined as follows:

1. `SOLCAP_SERVICES` as a JVM property which directly contains the manifest itself.
2. `SOLCAP_SERVICES` as an OS environment which directly contains the manifest itself.
3. `SOLACE_SERVICES_HOME` as a JVM property that specifies a path to a directory containing a `.solaceservices` file.
4. `SOLACE_SERVICES_HOME` as an OS environment that specifies a path to a directory containing a `.solaceservices` file.
5. Fallback of searching for a `.solaceservices` file in the user's home directory.

Now to marshal the JSON into `SolaceServiceCredentials` objects, the manifest must conform to one of the following formats:

| Manifest Format | Manifest Detection Handle | Service ID Resolution Order | Example |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------| ------ |
| `VCAP_SERVICES`-Formatted Map of Services | An object-type root node with key "solace-messaging" | <ol><li>An ID in the credentials</li><li>The service's meta-name</li><li>`{VPN-name}@{active-management-hostname}`</li></ol> | [Link](samples/vcap-formatted-manifest.json) |
| Array of Service Credentials | An array-type root node | <ol><li>An ID in the credentials</li><li>`{VPN-name}@{active-management-hostname}`</li></ol> | [Link](samples/service-credentials-list-manifest.json) |
| Service Credentials for a Single Service | Default | <ol><li>An ID in the credentials</li><li>`{VPN-name}@{active-management-hostname}`</li></ol> | [Link](samples/single-service-credentials-manifest.json) |


## Using it in your Application

The releases from this project are hosted in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.solace.cloud.core/solace-services-info).

### Using it with Gradle

```groovy
// Solace Services Info
compile("com.solace.cloud.core:solace-services-info:0.1.+")
```

### Using it with Maven

```xml
<!-- Solace Services Info -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.solace.cloud.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>solace-services-info</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.+</version>
</dependency>
```

## Checking out and Building

This project depends on maven for building. To build the jar locally, check out the project and build from source by doing the following:

    git clone https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-services-info.git
    cd solace-services-info
    mvn package

This will build a jar file which will be named similar to the following:

```
target/solace-services-info-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

You can install this file in your maven repository locally.
